        <p class="aboutJoe">
          My name is Joe Rutkin. Before studying software development, I spent
          five years as a cheesemonger, building relationships with customers
          and colleagues where I gained an expertise in interpersonal skills
          through interactions with my clients and co-workers. Iâ€™ve always been
          interested in techonology and problem solving. Software development
          was a logical next step for me. I love collaborating with teammates
          while creating catered solutions for clients, utilizing my customer
          service background to build tight-knit teams while meeting customer
          needs.

        <p class="aboutMegan">
          My name is Megan Seibert-Hughes. Before I became a full-stack
          JavaScript developer, I worked as a Psychological Operations
          Specialist, a Medical Courier, and had a pet sitting business on the
          side. I decided to learn Software Development after taking an
          introductory course through General Assembly. I chose the Full-Stack
          JavaScript route, because through the introductory course I discovered
          a passion for solving problems in creative ways that could help other
          people. I'm also more of a visual person with a background in design,
          experience in freelance web design, as well as music production.
          Naturally, Full-Stack JavaScript was the ideal choice.
